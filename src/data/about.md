# Intro
I build things that push the boundaries of **AI, perception systems, and mobile development**. Whether itâ€™s **teaching self-driving cars how to see**, **making AI-generated videos a reality**, or **optimizing real-time video streaming**, I love tackling hard technical problems and turning them into real products. Right now, Iâ€™m working as an **ML Algo Engineer**, focusing on making **autonomous vehicles smarter** with AI and computer vision. Before that, I founded **Dubbles**, an AI-powered text-to-video app, and **Spur**, a social app that hit **350,000+ downloads**, proving that people really do want AI to do their creative work for them. Iâ€™ve also designed **AI classifiers for medical diagnostics**, with one of my models published in **PNAS** (and cited **89 times!**). If you ever need to make something **fast, scalable, and AI-powered**, Iâ€™m your guy.  


<!-- # Some History
- My education and experience have equipped me with advanced technical skills, enabling me to lead projects that integrate theory and practice to solve complex technology challenges.

- My tech journey started with a passion for using software to tackle complex problems and enhance lives. At Harvard, I specialized in AI and machine learning, advancing the field with innovative research. This work deepened my expertise and honed my analytical skills, essential for creating scalable and efficient solutions.

- At Lucid Motors, I used my skills to lead the development of an advanced application that works smoothly with our electric vehicles' systems. This project focused on improving the interaction between software and hardware, aiming to enhance both user experience and vehicle performance. The application features keyless entry and customized navigation for electric vehicles, and its success reflects my ability to lead a team and innovate.

- Beyond technical skills, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to found my own company, Spur, where I took the product from conception to launch. Managing Spur taught me invaluable lessons in building and leading teams, understanding customer needs, and executing complex projects under tight deadlines. Our application reached over 100,000 users and several hundred thousand downloads, highlighting my capability to scale technologies effectively.

- I am particularly passionate about the potential of AI to revolutionize industries. My experience ranges from academic research at prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford to practical applications in the tech industry. I am eager to bring this passion to a team that values bold ideas and is committed to pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. -->
