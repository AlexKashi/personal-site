# Intro
I am a Staff Software Engineer at [Lucid Motors](https://www.lucidmotors.com/) and a graduate of the [Harvard Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-computational-science-and-engineering) master's program. I have founded companies, leading them from conception through launch. My applications have scaled to over 100,000 users, accumulating several hundred thousand downloads. I have advanced the state of the art in AI through my research at Harvard and Stanford, and I am passionate about enabling the next generation of AI services and applications.


<!-- # Some History
- My education and experience have equipped me with advanced technical skills, enabling me to lead projects that integrate theory and practice to solve complex technology challenges.

- My tech journey started with a passion for using software to tackle complex problems and enhance lives. At Harvard, I specialized in AI and machine learning, advancing the field with innovative research. This work deepened my expertise and honed my analytical skills, essential for creating scalable and efficient solutions.

- At Lucid Motors, I used my skills to lead the development of an advanced application that works smoothly with our electric vehicles' systems. This project focused on improving the interaction between software and hardware, aiming to enhance both user experience and vehicle performance. The application features keyless entry and customized navigation for electric vehicles, and its success reflects my ability to lead a team and innovate.

- Beyond technical skills, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to found my own company, Spur, where I took the product from conception to launch. Managing Spur taught me invaluable lessons in building and leading teams, understanding customer needs, and executing complex projects under tight deadlines. Our application reached over 100,000 users and several hundred thousand downloads, highlighting my capability to scale technologies effectively.

- I am particularly passionate about the potential of AI to revolutionize industries. My experience ranges from academic research at prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford to practical applications in the tech industry. I am eager to bring this passion to a team that values bold ideas and is committed to pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. -->
