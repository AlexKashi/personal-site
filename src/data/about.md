# Intro
I build things that push the boundaries of AI, perception systems, and mobile development. Whether itâ€™s teaching self-driving cars how to see, making AI-generated videos a reality, or optimizing real-time video streaming, I love tackling hard technical problems and turning them into real products. Right now, Iâ€™m working as a **Senior Perception Engineer**, focusing on making autonomous vehicles smarter with AI and computer vision. Before that, I founded **Dubbles**, an AI-powered text-to-video app that hit **350,000+ downloads**, proving that people really do want AI to do their creative work for them. Iâ€™ve also designed **AI classifiers for medical diagnostics**, with one of my models published in **PNAS** (and cited **89 times!**). Somewhere along the way, I got deep into **iOS development, WebRTC, and AWS**, so if you ever need to make something **fast, scalable, and AI-powered**, Iâ€™m your guy.
